        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Alberta and currently based out of Edmonton.
          Due to my passion for innovative technology, I would love to work for a design studio that allows me to apply
          mechanical design principles to consumer, industrial, and commercial products that are changing the world.<br></p>

        <p>My most recent work stint was at John Deere where I designed, prototyped, and manufactured production tools used in transmission assembly lines.
          Oftentimes, the process involved bouncing ideas back and forth with technicians and turning an idea or sketch drawn on a napkin into something tangible the next day.
           My past experiences have instilled the importance of leveraging user input and utilizing user-centered design, lessons I carry with me to this day.<br></p>

        <p>I can gladly say that I am a product of my environment. Growing up in a landlocked and cold Canadian province
          like Alberta has made me appreciate any opportunity I get to enjoy the outdoors. Shredding gnar pow on my snowboard,
          running trails, or a mouth full of sand after playing beach volleyball is when I am the happiest.</p>
